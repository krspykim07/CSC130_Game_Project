# CSC130 Basic 2D Game Development | DSA Course Project

This project is from CSC130 Data Structure at California State University, Sacramento. The goal of this project is to implement the concepts of data structure to generate the game. This project was given a portion of the professor's, whos name is Matthew Phillips, game engine as a base point. Throughout the course, we were assigned to complete the checkpoints introducing different data structures and applying it to the game.
